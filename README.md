This repository contains a machine learning model designed for recognizing hand gestures. The model uses computer vision techniques to detect, classify, and interpret different hand gestures. It can be applied in a wide range of applications, from gesture-based controls to sign language recognition.

Features
Hand Detection: Uses image processing techniques to detect hands in images or video streams.
Gesture Classification: Classifies hand gestures into predefined categories.
Real-time Processing: Capable of handling real-time video input for live gesture recognition.
Customizable: Easily adaptable to include more hand gestures and patterns.
Pretrained Model: The repository includes a pretrained model that can be fine-tuned with your own dataset.
